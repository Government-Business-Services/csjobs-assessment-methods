                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Purpose</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body-m">Providing an alternative method of recommending assessment methods to vacancy holders - more seamlessly compared to the Triage concept - so the recommendation is relevant within the context of the vacancy holder's task and moment of 'decision' making.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body-m">The notion of using persuasion principles to encourage the adoption of a sound, robust recommendation is a well-established mechanism across most of the social media, ecommerce or media services that we use everyday. Is there any reason why it wouldn't be just as effective when recommending selection criteria and assessment methods to vacancy holders?</p>


                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Assumptions</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body-m">We assume that it would be reasonable to expect the service to make meaningful and viable recommendations after a number of campaign set-up tasks have been completed.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body-m">We assume that if we were to make a 'sound' recommendation to a vacancy holder, and provide a robust rationale for it, at that moment vacancy holders might be tipped in favour of agreement.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body-m">We assume that Civil Servants (and vacancy holders in particular) don't possess any superpowers that would render them immune from the normal behavioural responses that people often have when persuasion principles are used with recommendations elsewhere.</p>


                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Hypotheses</h3>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                  <li>We believe that, the use of a persuasion tactic as part of a recommendation of selection criteria or assessment methods to a vacancy holder could be effective in 'converting' a recommendation into adoption.</li>
                  <li>We believe that, it will be possible to simulate the vacancy holder participant's suspension of disblief sufficiently to engage an instinctive behavioural response to the persuasion stimulus provided (in a manner than can be observed or explained by the participant).</li>
                  <li>We believe that, whilst the persuasion stimulus hasn't be expertly crafted by a specialist, our use of common 'message patterns' will still be capable of rendering an effect.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Design direction</h3>

                <p class="govuk-body-m">For the purpose of expedience we:</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                  <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-3">re-used various design components that had already undergone a fair deal of testing during prior iterations to construct a campaign set-up harness for this prototype context.</li>
                  <LI class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-3">decided to present a scenario to participants where they had already completed much of the campaign set-up task and were about to embark on the assessment methods section.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="govuk-body-m"></p>

                <p class="govuk-body-m">We attempted to experiment with the following persuasion principles applied to recommendations to assess their impact on vacancy holder's perceptions and behaviours.</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                  <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-3">Social proof: <strong>"xx% of other vacancy holders in your situation made the following decision".</strong></li>
                  <LI class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-3">Competition and advantage: <strong>"there are n competing roles on CS jobs right now, if you do x you will achieve y".</strong></li>
                  <LI class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-3">Overwhelming evidence: <strong>"77% of users typically look at a job ad for the first time on a mobile phone, and only spend 11 seconds on the page, if you do x and y you'll increase the chance of attracting the right applicants".</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p class="govuk-body-m">The recommendations were placed at the primary decision points for picking selection criteria and assessment methods.</p>


                <p class="govuk-body-m">There were various opt-in / out devices that were considered during the design which weren't possible to build, these are described in the backlog below.</p>


                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Results</h3>
                <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">What worked well</h4>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                  <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-3">Whilst not viewed positively by observers, the use of the simple CTA, "I'm not sure - help me choose" on the behaviours selection page was reasonably effective in achieving its purpose: to provide a way to engage those vacancy holders that were looking for support without forcing the recommendation.</li>
                  <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-3">The use of background shading was effective in sign-posting the inline recommendation 'action' area on the page (however there would need to be an effective alternative avaiable to activate screen readers to this visual call-to-action).</li>
                  <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-3">The the recommendation intro panel at the top of the page wasn't always effective, particularly on longer pages. However, it's worth emphasising that the mechanism is there and easy to find IF the user is looking for support. Similarly if they don't need it they can ignore it.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">What didn't work well</h4>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                  <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-3">The online tests page was created and inserted into the journey structure to expose vacancy holders to the list of tests available before further progressing onto selection criteria and assessment methods - whilst not stated explicitly, the page seemed to jar with participants, perthaps this is due to the previous step where they were invited to select the SP elements they wanted to use?</li>
                  <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-3">On the strengths page, the recommendation trigger wasn't effective (although most participants didn't express any inate desire to use strengths). This may have been due to the poor layout of the page and lack of content to engage users that were not interested in searching, or may have been due to a lack of interest or understanding. The strengths page should be reviewed again to place greater emphasis on inline elements that can be readily viewed and interacted with in additon to search.</li>
                  <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-3">On the Experience page some data was presented to the user, "77% of users typically look at a job ad for the first time on a mobile phone, and only spend 11 seconds on the page", whilst it was interesting it was not particularly helpful without any clear suggested action for the user to take.</li>

                </ul>

                <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Decision point</h4>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                  <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-3">If the concept is taken forward a stronger experiment may be required to craft and test the use of persuasive principles more explicitly to determine their value for encouraging adoption.</li>
                  <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-3">The approach of having a online tests page is likely to be acceptable, however forcing vacancy holders through (the gift shop) didn't work and seemed to be counter-productive. Recommend that we take the online test page forward, but rather than adding it forcibly into the task list, we should find a way to present it alongside the SP elements (given the step is about making choices), as this will be the most empowering experience for users.</li>
                  <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-3">If a recommendation panel is used, it's important that we take forward the concept of providing the guidance, followed by the rationale. Pure stats on their own are not always useful (a la Experience page).</li>
                  <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-3">The strengths page should be revisited to readdress the balance of functionality on the page to reduce the reliance on search. Support of Occ Psy needed to find a way of presented curated content on the page, e.g., categories of strengths selection as well as behaviours linking etc.</li>
                </ul>

                              <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Background</h3>
                              <p class="govuk-body-m">The job template idea was conceived during Discovery and further developed during Alpha. The template spec would be used to pre-fill various parts of the campaign set-up task list, including selection criteria and assessment methods. Vacancy holders would be offered a template based a few preliminary questions, which would effectively fast track them through the set-up journey.</p>
                              <p class="govuk-body-m">In terms of selection and assessment, the template would include a pre-defined assessment â€˜packâ€™ (carefully chosen set of selection criteria and assessment methods as recommended by experts). The experience would be further enhanced with guidance provided to vacancy holders in-line, in the context of their task when using the service.</p>

                              <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Assumptions</h3>
                              <p class="govuk-body-m">We assumme that vacancy holders would welcome the concept of using templates which contain pre-defined assessment â€˜packsâ€™ because it would provide confidence of getting it right, or maybe simply because they're interested to see how others do it.</p>
                              <p class="govuk-body-m">We anticipate that trust (trust in the source and their credibility or trust in the service etc) may play a part in how willing users are to embrace template use, and accept the implied recommendations without lots of editing.</p>
                              <p class="govuk-body-m">We found out during Alpha that vacancy holders would invariably cite their need for control in configuring the campaign as they saw fit - we assume that any template with recommended assessment methods would be no different.</p>

                              <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Hypotheses</h3>
                              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                                <li>We believe that if we could present a strong, robust basis to the template, vacancy holders would be more likely to 'suspend disbelief' and try it out when presented with it 'cold'.</li>
                                <li>We suspect that vacancy holders would expect to be provided with the details underpinning the template before trying it out - we believe that there will be specific factors influencing the amount and kind of information needed by vacancy holders to 'suspend disbelief'.</li>
                                <li>We believe that if a credible 'trustmark' could be identified and affiliated with the template, this would further encourage a 'suspension of disbelief' by vacancy holders.</li>
                              </ul>
                              <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Design direction</h3>
                              <p class="govuk-body-m">We decided to re-use various design components that had already undergone a fair deal of testing during Alpha to construct the campaign set-up harness for this prototype.</p>
                              <p class="govuk-body-m">The components included a textarea with autocomplete to search for limited taxonomy items (e.g., jobtitle), standard select dropdowns (grade and profession) and the task-list pattern provided task structure after vacancy holders pick a template.</p>
                              <p class="govuk-body-m">For the template selection page, we experimented with various 'trust' devices in the information design to assess their impact on vacancy holder preferences and perceptions:</p>

                              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                                <li>What is the impact of having the template 'made' by a named Department?</li>
                                <li>What is the impact of attributing the template to a Civil Service Profession?</li>
                                <li>What meaning is implied by date information when presented with the template 'details'?</li>
                                <li>What impact does using template 'performance' information have on vacancy holders?</li>
                                <li>If template performance information is shown, how should it appear to the user?</li>
                              </ul>

                              <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Two versions of the template selection page were designed</h3>
                              <p class="govuk-body-m">Each version used the 'trust' devices differently, for example:</p>
                              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                                <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-6"><strong>Information on the performance of the template</strong><br>â€” Original provided statements about the job ad in a prose,<br>â€” Alternative cited statistics</li>
                                <li><strong>Number of matching templates available</strong><br>â€” Original offered up a single template,<br>â€” Alternative had two templates, one associated with a department and the other a profession (both cases displaying their respective logos a la trustmark)</li>
                              </ul>


                              <div class="govuk-grid-row">

                              <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-6">Results</h3>
                              <p class="govuk-body-m">Overall, the job library template prototype performed reasonably well. </p>

                              <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">What worked well</h4>
                              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                                <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">Providing information on template performance proved to be quite significant, however the precise choice of metrics does require careful consideration, for example suggesting that a template was effective because it managed to attract a large number of applicants is quite a devisive idea depending on what that means in your context (i.e, previous attempts have failed to attract much interest).</li>
                                <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">Presenting template performance information using metrics, and in particular use of percentages was seen as compelling.</li>
                                <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">In addition to the template details, a number of participants wanted to see a previous job ad that used the template (I suspect that a preview of the job ad is likely to be a deciding factor).</li>
                                <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">Some participants stated a need to focus on their departmental templates, whilst others seemed intrigued by other departments and said they'd be interested in seeing how they did it.</li>
                              </ul>


                              <div style="width:95%;border-radius:10px;background:#F4FAFF;border:1px solid #1d70b8;padding:20px">
                                <h4 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-0">How important is the vacancy's area of specialisation?</h4>

                                <p class="govuk-body-m">Is it possible that a vacancy holder that works within a particular domain that might be more convinced by a job library template from another gov function or profession that operates within the same domain?</p>
                                <p class="govuk-body-m">For example, when recruiting for a Data scientist, there's a good chance that there will be common behaviours or strengths that could be used to assess candidates irrespective of the department.</p>
                                <p class="govuk-body-m">However a Data scientist required to join an Actuarial Science team would probably need Technical skills and Experience of using specific frameworks and mathematical models when doing their job. Or, a Data scientist needed for a team that models epidemiological data to predict how a new virus might spread, would also need to possses a particular piece of domain knowledge?</p>
                                <p class="govuk-body-m"><strong>So, if this premise were true, could the use of 'social proof' help reinforce the credibility of a template offered to a vacancy holder within the realm of their working domain model?</strong>

                                <h4 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-6">What didn't work well</h4>
                                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                                  <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">When presenting more than 1 template option to users, it's important that any data, metrics etc shown is common to all templates listed (to allow vacancy holders to compare and decide).</li>
                                  <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">Automatically marking items in the task list as 'completed' was problematic. There was a strong expectation that an action performed by the template (i.e., pre-filling parts of the set-up) could not be 'completed' without their involvement, review etc.</li>
                                  <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">Upon selection of the template (<strong>step 1 below</strong>), participants were presented with a partially 'completed' task-list with no single, strong CTA connect to (<strong>step 2 below</strong>) - it quickly became apparent that many participants found the transition disjointed and disorientating.</li>

                                  <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">The content of the 'compelling fact' needs to be identified and expressed with careful consideration to avoid backlash.</li>

                                              <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Background</h3>
                                              <p class="govuk-body-m">The so-called 'Triage' recommendation concept is more akin to a diagnostic or risk assessment tool - the service would get the data needed from the vacancy holder up front, through a series of questions, process and then present various recommendations depending on the answers (or profile) provided.</p>

                                              <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Assumptions</h3>
                                              <p class="govuk-body-m">We assume that there are a finite (short!) number of questions that must be answered by the vacancy holder in order make it possible to recommend in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
                                              <p class="govuk-body-m">We assume that vacancy holders will respond to a call-to-action to activate it the service, rather than it becoming activated without any user action.</p>
                                              <p class="govuk-body-m">Like the template assumption above, we suspect that the amount of evidence 'rigour' required by users to 'suspend disbelief' will be dervied from specific factors, which we should aim to shed light on.</p>


                                              <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Hypotheses</h3>
                                              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                                                <li>We believe that if we could present a strong, robust basis to the recommendation provided, vacancy holders would be more likely to 'suspend disbelief' and reflect and consider the offered guidance (offered relatively 'cold').</li>
                                                <li>We suspect that vacancy holders would expect a recommendation to be accompanied with the details, rationale etc before any willingness to give it a go.</li>
                                              </ul>
                                              <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Design direction</h3>
                                              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                                                <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-3">We envisage the service would be relatively passive or reactive in its nature - much in the same way a triage nurse might briefly interview an A&E arrival to assess the problem and determine the right priority for treatment (depending on policy and the desired outcome). But unlike an A&E situation, our service would attempt to diagnose any risks that may impact the recruitment process.</li>
                                                <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-3">Given this, the intro content, scene setting etc will have heavy burden to articulate the proposition on offer to set set context and set vacancy holders expectations.</li>
                                              </ul>


                                              <p class="govuk-body-m">We experimented with 2 ways of showing the recommendation:</p>
                                              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                                                <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">What is the impact of varying the visibility of the rationale behind the recommendation? (a la progressive disclosure strategy)</li>
                                                <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">What is the impact of leading the recommendation with the rationale BEFORE the guidance vice versa?</li>
                                                <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">What impact does using template 'performance' information have on vacancy holders?</li>
                                                <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">If template performance information is shown, how should it appear to the user?</li>
                                              </ul>

                                              <p class="govuk-body-m">We decide to omit the use of 'performance' data, metrics etc related to the recommendation, instead focusing on expressing the rationale a prose form.</p>

                                              <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Results</h3>
                                              <p class="govuk-body-m">Overall, the triage concept didn't test as well as the template prototype.</p>
                                              <p class="govuk-body-m">I suspect, our assumptions regarding the question answering stage at the start, with hindsight, was naive - one or two of the questions confused most participants, rendering a few to say, "I have no idea".</p>
                                              <p class="govuk-body-m">The perceived relevance of the questions being asked of the vacancy holder, particularly at the start of the journey, undoubtedly had a negative impact on the next stage when the recommendation was revealed.</p>

                                              <p class="govuk-body-m">Our design concept didn't backup the questions with any rationale for them - indeed the rationale wasn't shown until the recommendation was revealed.  We didn't anticipate this reaction, and it's possible that the lack of explanation for the questions may have made vacancy holders feel suspicous or slightly irritated.</p>
                                              <p class="govuk-body-m">The triage concept didn't convey any 'performance' data or metrics to further support the recommendation, which may have been a serious ommission.</p>
                                              <p class="govuk-body-m">Despite, the less than positive start, many participants were philosphical about the recommendations presented.</p>

                                              <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">What worked well</h4>
                                              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                                                <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">On the Original design, the recommendation and rationale given seemed to be clear and well-understood by participants. There was a fair degree of variance on the perceived 'credibility' of the recommendations, some of the participants held quite strong views on the use of tests in the process, which wasn't well received.</li>
                                                <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">On the Alternative design, separating the recommedations by stage seemed to help participants understand what we being recommended more effectively, even if they disagreed with it.</li>
                                                <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">Various participants implied that, even if they disagreed with the recommendation, they viewed them in the broader context of reflection and review.</li>
                                                <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">Some participants asked whether the recommendation would 'follow' them through the campaign set-up process, as a reminder of the recommendation. Whilst observers weren't convinced that this would fuel a u-turn on a decision, the sentiment could be interpreted as a desire to ensure that their decisons are taken consciously (and for their reasons).</li>
                                                <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">Some participants (minority) viewed a few of the recommendations as interesting and felt that they might use them during the selection task. Or at a minimum encourage them to think differently during the task of selection.</li>
                                              </ul>

                                              <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">What didn't work well</h4>
                                              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                                                <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">Obviously, the first triage step with the questions was less than fit for purpose, but the mechanism itself didn't necessarily fail. It's possible, that our initial premise (keeping the questions short to hasten the reveal of the recommendation) may have been miguided.</li>
                                                <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">On the Alternative design, hiding the rationale for the recommendation under the click 'reveal' panel performed very poorly indeed, one participant suggested that the bullets should be 'expanded by default'.</li>
                                                <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">When an online test was part of a recommendation, some participants asked about seeing the details, suggesting that even if they were interested the information provided enough to allow them to seriously reflect on their use.</li>
                                                <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">One participant mentioned that the cost side of online tests wasn't addressed with a recommendation, which would have been a barrier for them anyway.</li>

                                                <li class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">The importance of giving the rationale for both the question and at the point of revealing the recommendation is clearly a big deal and should be taken forward as a user need.</li>

                                                            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Assumptions</h3>

                                                              <li>We believe that if we treated Abilities in the same way as other SP elements which can be used to identify relevant selection criteria, vacancy holders might perceive tests as just another assessment method choice available to test their criteria.</li>
                                                              <li>We suspect that moving the first summary review check point to appear after the assignment of criteria to stage, would provide vacancy holders with a more profound context for reflection than merely just the criteria.</li>
                                                              <li>We believe that an alternative presentation and layout for the final summary/review screen that emphasises the vacancy holders most recent decisions (picking methods rather than criteria) might be more effective in supporting them when reviewing and finalising the choices made at each assessment stage.</li>

This further increased our confidence on the effacy of the design solution.</p>
                                                            <p class="govuk-body-m">By comparison, our approach to Abilities performed very poorly indeed. Upon reflection, even if the hypothesis were to be sound, the fact that users struggle to distinguish abilities from skills (and strengths) and the very limited/specific method choice available... back to the drawing board.</p>

                                                              <li>The concept of using search/autocomplete to help users find strengths (a la interactive dictionary!) did seem to land positively, however there were worries about knowing what they should type if they are unfamiliar with the dictionary. The notion of strengths linked to behaviours was mentioned and may provide a credible alternative to search on the page.</li>

The intention of raising awareness around the Judgement test as an alternative means of assessing behaviours at sift confused many users, leading to more questions without any more answers.</li>

It wasn't clear to users that a single personal statement (up to 1250 words) would be used to draw together multiple selection criteria (rather than a personal statement for each). When dealing with methods that are avaialble in a single instance, a more effective mechanism is needed to draw the other criteria that might be used.</li>

                                                                        <p class="govuk-body-m">Vacancy holders have a strong desire to be provided with support and guidance.</p>
                                                                        <p class="govuk-body-m">Vacancy holders have a need to be able to specify and configure their selection criteria and assessment methods in a detailed, granular way - rather than their choices being rolled up, they want to make small changes to how they plan to assess on an individual basis (e.g., using different tactics when using strengths rather than just 1 for all).</p>
                                                                        <p class="govuk-body-m">(Some) vacancy holders need to add additional stages into their recruitment plan beyond merely sift and interview stages, and the service should enable that if required.</p>

                                                                        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Overarching hypothesis</h3>

                                                                        <p class="govuk-body-m">We believe that if we provided users with a structured, guided process they would be better equipped to identify the most appropriate selection criteria and assessment methods for their specific role and particular circumstance. After all, this is another job in additon to their day job! So if we step forward with our expertise, we can help them navigate through and reach the right outcome.</p>

                                                                        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Design direction</h3>


                                                                        <p class="govuk-body-m">It could be argued that v.02. adds an additional step into the process by virtue of drawing out an explicit stage for assigning methods at sift and interview - compared to v.01. which encouraged the vacancy holder to review their criteria and assign both the stage and the method in the same step.</p>
                                                                        <p class="govuk-body-m">However, an alternative point of view could be that the further step at stage provides an additional opportunity to reflect on what is being decided and each stage and why. In the same way, the moment provides an opportunty for vacancy holders to cognitively 'pull through' what they have done and fine tune in light of the bigger picture.</p>



                                                                        <!-- <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet"> -->
                                                                        <p class="govuk-body-m">In the same way, enabling vacancy holders to pick multiple success profile elements at the start of the journey to allow them to create all their desired selection criteria in 'one sitting' is part of a broader perspective that emphasises the connectedness of all the facets of their plan.</p>
                                                                        <p class="govuk-body-m">It's worth mentioning that this feature does introduce new design challenges compared to v.01. Should the chosen success profile elements appear all on the same page or sub-divided by element? For the purpose of this iteration, both were modelled and tested with users as variant A and B.</p>


                                                                        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Results</h3>

The anchor links provided at the top to allow jumping to anchor sections on the page were invariably missed by some and those that did notice, didn't seem to reduce their burden significantly.</li>
                                                                          <li>Only providing 3 textboxes to add their 'experience' criteria was perceived as far too limiting, however the principle of delineating the criteria by 1 in each box was regarded as providing greater flexibility when it comes to deciding how and when to assess that particular criterion (rather than all of them being treated in the same way).</li>
                                                                          <li>The experience of assigning assessment methods to criteria at sift and then interview stages which easy from an interaction point of view proved to be inadequate regarding the descriptions of the methods.</li>

This is understood to be a poor experience and isn't in the spirit of the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/check-answers/">Check answers pattern</a>. This was a compromise to allow greater focus on riskier assumptions in the journey.</li>
